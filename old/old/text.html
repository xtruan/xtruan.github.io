&page1_readmore2=MIX09 Trip
&page1_readmore_title2=Microsoft MIX09 Trip
&page1_readmore_txt2=During the second semester of my sophomore year I entered a contest to win a trip to Microsoft MIX09, Microsoft's developers conference focusing on internet based technology. My essay was selected as one of the winners of this contest and I was lucky enough to be able to go. They flew me out to Las Vegas and put me up in the Venetian Hotel for the entire conference, which I was also given a pass to attend!<br><br>At the conference I learned a lot about emerging web technologies, saw the launch of Internet Explorer 8, and was introduced to the concept of "UX" or user experience. I left the conference with a firm understanding of developing software, and products in general that are focused on usability, and a good experience for the intended user. The trip was one of the most academically and personally exciting things I have ever done, and I will never forget the things I learned and the memories I made.<br><br><font color="#2B547E" size="14"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/mix/default.aspx"><b><u>Microsoft MIX Homepage</u></b></a>

&second_title1=Computer Experience
&page2_txt1=I've been using computers from a very young age and have developed a lot of understanding along the way. This experience has helped me develop proficiency in both software and hardware areas. I've sort of become the "go to guy" when my friends are having computer issues.
&second_title2=Technical Work Experience
&page2_txt2=I have experience working as an intern at Sun Microsystems as a Tier 1 Support Technician. This position involved interpreting and diagnosing technical issues from customers in a time critical environment. My job responsibilities included determinining which alerts require attention, reaching out to customers in a professional manner, and correcting technical issues on remote servers.

&page2_readmore_title1=Computer Experience
&page2_readmore_txt1=I've built three computers from scratch and upgraded hardware in all the others I've owned. I've also tinkered considerably with the software and operating systems on these machines, giving me a detailed understanding of Windows, various Linux flavors, and Mac OS X.<br><br>One of my favorite facets of computing is networking. Networking has always been one of the most intriguing aspects of computing for me. I've developed experience setting up wired ethernet networks involving modems, routers, and switches. In addition to wired, I've also implemented wireless networks using the 802.11 specification. I secured these networks with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption schemes.

/////////////  Fourth Page   ////////////

&fourth_title1=Current Project
&fourth_txt1=I am currently working on a train mapping and identification system involving many interconnected embedded systems. The system will be capable of identifying the engine and freight cars in a passing train as well as capable of "mapping" a track. Identification of the engine and freight cars will be "learned" from sensors rather than something simple like a barcode. Similarly, the layout of the track as well as any problem or rough areas in the track will be "learned" by sensors on a freight car. The system will be independent of the track layout or specific composition of engines and freight cars. Note that the system will not be capable of distinguishing between very similar freight cars or engines, but this capability is an important aspect of judging success. The use of more than one sensor type in "measuring" a car will be helpful.

&fourth_title2=Other Projects
 
&fourth_txt2=Another project I developed utilized concepts of microprocessor system design. It was an etch-a-sketch implemented on a Spartan 3E FPGA. It involved writing C code to take input from a PS2 mouse, and display output on a VGA monitor. The C code I wrote had several major functions including enabling and interpreting data from a mouse, converting this information to visual information stored in a frame buffer, and displaying this frame buffer to a monitor.


&page4_readmore1=Technical Info.
&page4_readmore_title1=Train Project
&page4_readmore_txt1=This project uses a Xilinx Spartan 3E containing an FPGA configured as a 32 bit Microblaze processor. This processor communicates to a series of Microchip PIC 18 processors using the I2C communication protocol. These PICs are connected to sensors which read information about the position and makeup of a model train. This information in turn is used to generate a map of the track, and a manifest of the train's cargo (by car configuration). The purpose of the project is to develop the ability to design a complex embedded system, with many interconnected components, from the ground up.

&page4_readmore2=More Projects
&page4_readmore_title2=Other Projects
&page4_readmore_txt2=I also developed a microprocessor using gate level logic. This processor was implemented with NAND gates, inverters, an adder, four multiplexers, and D flip flops. My microprocessor performed six simple operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication by two.<br><br>More information via download:<font color="#0000FF"><br><a href="files/StruanClark_Lab4_2534.doc"><b><u>Etch-a-Sketch Code Overview (.doc)</u></b></a><br><a href="files/StruanClark_Lab2_2504.doc"><b><u>Basic Microprocessor Writeup (.doc)</u></b></a></font>
