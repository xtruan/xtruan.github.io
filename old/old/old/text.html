&index_title1=About Me
&index_txt1=I'm currently a junior at Virginia Tech in the Computer Engineering program. Besides my major related classes, I also enjoy working on computers and other electronics in my spare time.<br><br>Although I now live in the US, I was born in Scotland and lived there till I was ten.
&index_title2=Additional Information
&index_txt2=More information about me, including technical experience, my resume, some of my computer engineering projects, and my contact information are available through the links to the left.

&second_title1=Computer Experience
&second_txt1=I've been using computers from a very young age and have developed a lot of understanding along the way. This experience has helped me develop proficiency in both software and hardware areas. I've sort of become the "go to guy" when my friends are having computer issues.<br>I've built three computers from scratch and upgraded hardware in all the others I've owned. I've also tinkered considerably with the software and operating systems on these machines, giving me a detailed understanding of Windows, various Linux flavors, and Mac OS X. 
&second_title2=Networking Experience
&second_txt2=Networking has always been one of the most intriguing aspects of computing for me. I've developed experience setting up wired ethernet networks involving modems, routers, and switches. In addition to wired, I've also implemented wireless networks using the 802.11 specification. I secured these networks with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption schemes.
&second_title3=Technical Work Experience
&second_txt3=I'm currently an intern at Sun Microsystems as a Tier 1 Support Technician. This position involves interpreting and diagnosing technical issues from customers in a time critical environment. My job responsibilities include determinining which alerts require attention, reaching out to customers in a professional manner, and correcting technical issues on remote servers.

&fourth_title1=Projects
&fourth_txt1=The most recent project I developed utilized concepts of microprocessor system design. It was an etch-a-sketch implemented on a Spartan 3E FPGA. It involved writing C code to take input from a PS2 mouse, and display output on a VGA monitor. The C code I wrote had several major functions including enabling and interpreting data from a mouse, converting this information to visual information stored in a frame buffer, and displaying this frame buffer to a monitor.
&fourth_txt2=I also developed a microprocessor using gate level logic. This processor was implemented with NAND gates, inverters, an adder, four multiplexers, and D flip flops. My microprocessor performed six simple operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication by two.
